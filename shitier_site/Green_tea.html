			<h3>The best way to start with green tea is to grab a small box of 15 or so tea bags from the grocery store. Unwrap one bag and plunk it into water just off its boiling point. Let it steep for 5 minutes or so. The box will include suggestions for brewing time. Remove the bag with the help of a spoon. Squeeze lightly. Toss. Consume before it cools down too much, letting the flavor introduce itself to you sip by sip.
Next cup you can add milk or sweetener or anything you think might kick up the enjoyment level. A squeeze of fresh lemon or lime is a nice touch as is adding spices such as ground ginger or cinnamon.
If you are a fan of iced tea. Green tea can be brewed hot, cooled down and placed into the refrigerator. Pour over a glass of crushed ice. The brew ratios are about the same as for hot tea. One tea bag per 8 oz of water. If you like it stronger, use one tea bag per 6 oz. of water. Let it steep for up to 30 minutes. You can back down the steeping time if you find the tea becomes too bitter for your taste. Bitterness doesnâ€™t bother me. I like mine strong with no milk or sweetener.</h3>
