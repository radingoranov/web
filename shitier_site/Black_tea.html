		<h3>It largely depend on the persons taste and preference. Some people prefer their tea with sugar and milk while others like it just black. However some teas in general are found to go better with milk and sugar. For example malty and astringent black teas from Assam - India are better suited with milk and sugar as milk helps smoothening the string tea taste while enhancing the flavors. Some Ceylon black teas also go very well with Milk and sugar. Another point to consider is that the tea leaves which are cut into smaller pieces are usually oxidized more and thetefore more asringent and bitter and also yoeld color a lot faster that full tea leaces or Orange Pekoe tea leaves. These cut teas (CTC -crush, tear, curl) are sometimes considered better suited for milk and sugar. In general teas from India and ceylon are better candidates for milk and sugar addition.</h3>
